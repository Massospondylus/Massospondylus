- 👋 Hi, I’m @Massospondylus 
aka Martin Strauss

- 👀 I’m interested in Palaeontology, Archaeology and Chemical Engineering. 

I am particularly interested in combining knowledge from all 3 to aid in reconstructing past climates as a tool for palaeontological research
as well as identifying mineral or petroleum resources using past climates. 
I wish to aid in bringing more attention to southern African and African fossil finds as I feel there is not enough information
on these finds when compared to similar fossil finds in more developed areas.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning python while completing a degree in Chemical Engineering and a degree in Archaeology at the University of Cape Town. 
I am a final year student in Chemical Engineering and will complete my Archaeology degree end of 2022.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Palaeontological/Archaeological surveys and digs in Africa, paleo-climate modelling through isotope analysis, 
mineral and petroleum exploration, water quality monitoring and control in urban areas and sustainable engineering solutions to alleviate poverty and combat climate change,
particularly in Africa.
